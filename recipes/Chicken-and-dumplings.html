    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

</ul> 

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, melt butter. Then add celery, carrot, onion, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning. Stir to combine flavors, around 5 minutes. Next, make room to add chicken and cook until browned, around 3-5 minutes per side. </li>
    <li>Pour water to cover the chicken by about 3 inches, bring the water to a boil. Stir, making sure to scrap the browned parts off the bottom of the pot. Bring the heat down, simmer until chicken is tender, around 1 hour. Transfer both the chicken and the carrots out of pan to let them cool off.</li>
    <li>Put 1/4 cooking liquid into a bowl, let it cool for around 5 minutes. Put 2 tablespoons of flour, stir back into the pot. </li>
    <li>Put 2 cups of flour in a large bowl, cut in shortening with 2 knives until mixture forms pea-sized bits. Mix in chilled chicken broth until dough is combined.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead around 5 to 6 times; pat down to 1-inch thickness. Sprinkle lightly with flour; roll out to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut dough into squares with a sharp knife.</li>
    <li>Drop the squares in batches, into the simmering cooking liquid. Move the squares to the side with each addition. Leave the pot partially covered; simmer until dumplings are firm, about 12 minutes. If any dumplings stick together, seperate them. Remove from the heat; keep covered.</li>
    <li>Bone chicken; cut into bite-sized pieces and return to the pot. Chop carrot; return to the pot. Cool chicken and dumplings, about 30 minutes, before serving.</li>
