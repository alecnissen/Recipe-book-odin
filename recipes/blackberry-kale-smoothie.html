<h2>Description</h2> 
<p>A tasty drink consisting of all healthy ingredients which include kale, carrots, blackberry's, strawberry's, a banana, almond milk, and a touch of orange juice.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2> 
<ul> 
    <li>A blender, any variety will do</li>
    <li>3-4 large leaves of Kale</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of carrots</li>
    <li>1 cup of blackberry's</li>
    <li>1 cup of strawberry's</li>
    <li>One banana</li>
    <li>3-4 cups of unsweetened almond milk, may vary depending on blender size</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of orange juice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Put kale in blender first, compress leaves by pressing them down. Recommend using a fork to avoid cutting your hands against the blender's blades. Compressing the leaves will leave room for the other ingredients. </li>
    <li>Add carrots.</li> 
    <li>Next add the blackberry's.</li>
    <li>Then add the strawberry's.</li>
    <li>Banana will come next, however best to cut it up into small slices to make it easier to blend.</li>
    <li>Compress all ingredients using a fork before adding liquid.</li>
    <li>Fill the blender up with enough almond milk to cover almost all ingredients but leave about an inch or two to make space for the orange juice.</li>
    <li>Top off with orange juice.</li>
    <li>Make sure blender lid is secure and blend all ingredients for 2-3 minutes until consistency is right. If blender is stuck try to push the ingredients down or add a little more liquid.</li>
    <li>Ready to drink!</li>
